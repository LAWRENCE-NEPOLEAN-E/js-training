/* Linting is the process of analyzing and checking source code for potential errors, bugs, and stylistic inconsistencies. 
It is typically performed by automated tools called linters. 
Linters examine code to identify issues that may lead to runtime errors or cause unintended behavior. 
The purpose of linting is to catch these issues early in the development process and promote code quality, readability, and maintainability. */

// inJs we use ESLint

/*ESLint is the dominant tool for linting Node. js packages, and can be configured to enforce multiple coding styles. 
It is possible to define your own style definitions. */

/* Uses of Linters:
- Helps Maintain Code Quality and Consistency
- Identifies Issues Before They Occur at Runtime
-Helps Check for Errors

-Linters can identify certain programming errors earlier on that you may not have noticed while writing code. 
A linter can easily identify and warn about unused variables, using undefined functions, suspicious code constructs, potential bugs, syntax errors, 
and various other issues that may arise. */
